"Good morning. I’m Harshitha V, a third-year AI & Data Science student at Saveetha Engineering College. I am a versatile developer and data enthusiast with a strong technical foundation in Java, Python, and SQL, as well as proficiency in Excel and Power BI for business visualization.

During my internship as a Data Engineering Intern at Glencore, which was a huge learning curve, my role specifically involved auditing Excel sheets for errors and extracting unstructured tables from Outlook emails. I used Python, xlwings, and BeautifulSoup to automate those repetitive tasks, which significantly improved efficiency. This experience taught me that being a great engineer requires a mix of technical adaptability and a high level of attention to detail when collaborating in a professional team.

In college, I applied these same problem-solving skills to my mini project, LegalEase AI, where I used NLP libraries like NLTK and SpaCy to automate the analysis of dense, unstructured legal text. This project really sharpened my skills in feature engineering and taught me how to tackle unpredictable data challenges. I’ve also done automation using Python and built basic ML models.

Currently, I’m expanding my toolkit through the Google Data Analytics Certificate and exploring AWS to understand scalable cloud pipelines. I’m also an active participant on Kaggle and GitHub, as I love the process of continuous learning. My goal is to join a forward-thinking team in a Data or Software Engineering role where I can build impactful solutions and eventually transition into designing large-scale data workflows. Thank you for this opportunity."
