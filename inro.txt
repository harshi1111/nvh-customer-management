“Good morning/afternoon. I’m Harshitha V, currently in my 3rd year, 6th semester, pursuing a Bachelor’s in AI & Data Science at Saveetha Engineering College, Chennai.

I’m passionate about technology and data, with strong skills in Python, Java, and SQL, and I’m comfortable using Excel and Power BI for analysis and visualization. I’ve automated repetitive tasks using Python, built basic ML models, and worked on small projects analyzing business data like trends and performance metrics. I also practice on Kaggle datasets to strengthen my data analysis and problem-solving skills.

I completed a 1-month internship at Glencore as a Data Engineering Intern, where I scraped, cleaned, and updated datasets, and automated processes using Python, xlwings, and BeautifulSoup.

 This experience taught me to handle data efficiently, maintain accuracy, adapt quickly, and collaborate in a professional team.

In college, I worked on LegalEase AI, which automates legal document analysis using NLP. Handling unstructured text was challenging, but I overcame it using NLTK and SpaCy, which strengthened my problem-solving, feature engineering, and data preprocessing skills.

I’m currently completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate to improve workflow, reporting, and visualization, and I’m actively participating in Kaggle competitions for practical experience.

I enjoy working in teams, learning quickly, and tackling new challenges, and I want to work with real datasets to build practical solutions. Right now, my focus is on gaining hands-on experience, and over time, I hope to take on responsibilities in designing and optimizing data workflows.

Thank you for this opportunity.”
